# POS System for Car Wash

This is my first freelancing project which is done when I learning the basics of Java at my university. By doing this project I have learned serveral important things such as 
- Basics of java
- How to handle the customer
- How to manage the databases

and so many other things and many life lessons as well. As the basic technology stack I have used Java with SQLite database. Following are some of the sreenshots of the application.
